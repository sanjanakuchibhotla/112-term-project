# 112-term-project
 
This project is an image editor. It lets the user input images of their choice
and edit them using commands such as changing the rgb values, blurring, sharpening,
moving, and floodfill.

Run main.py to run the program. Test images used are 'dog.jpeg', 'duck.jpeg',
and 'square.jpeg', but the user can input their own files into the folder and
use them in the program. Saving the file at the end names it 'final image.jpeg'
and puts it in the same folder.

The user can press either the 'u' key or the undo button to undo.

Modules used:
- PIL
